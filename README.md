Install the dependencies for both folders, using the same command: npm install.

I should mention that for the frontend, I used Next.js.

Now, let's run the backend. It will run locally on port 3001 by default. To do this, use npm run dev. Once the backend is running on port 3001, go to the frontend and run npm run dev.

The web application is now ready to use without any issues.
